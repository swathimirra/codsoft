Task 2
Simple Calculator
Develop a calculator program that performs basic arithmetic
operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
division. Allow the user to input two numbers and choose an
operation to perform.
coding:
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{    
    char op;
    float a,b;
    cout<<"ENTER YOUR OPERATION : +, -, *, / ";
    cin>>op;
    cout<<"ENTER TWO NUMBERS : ";
    cin>>a>>b;
    cout<<"RESULT:";
    switch(op)
    {
        case '+':
        cout<<a<<" + "<<b<<" = "<<a+b;
        break;
        case '-':
        cout<<a<<" - "<<b<<" = "<<a-b;
        break;
        case '*':
        cout<<a<<" * "<<b<<" = "<<a*b;
        break;
        case '/':
        cout<<a<<" / "<<b<<" = "<<a/b;
        break;
        
        
    }
}
